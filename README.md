# Smart-Light-System
More than a century has passed since the creation of Thomas Edison’s light bulb. During these many decades, inventors, engineers, and scientists have improved upon the invention of the original light bulb. The Intelligent Light System is of those improvements, and it is the greatest thing since the light bulb. It uses several sensors to retrieve data which controls a matrix of lights whose brightness better fits the situation. These sensors include a light sensor, ultrasonic sensor, and real-time clock module to keep track of time. In a normal case, (a time between 8AM and 11AM) the matrix of lights turn on as long as there is movement once every ten minutes, and as long as there is a need for artificial light (the lights will not turn on or turn on only slightly if the ambient light in the room is already bright, but if it is dark, the lights will turn on bright). Earlier in the day, from 8AM to 8:15AM, the lights will turn on regardless of the ambient brightness and movement in order to wake the user up. During the night, from 12AM to 6AM, the light will only turn on halfway if there is movement. This will last for ten minutes where in the last two of those minutes, the ultrasonic sensor will look for movement. If there is movement, then the lights will turn on full-brightness because this means that the user is awake, and from then on, the device will respond as it would in a normal situation, until there is no movement sensed for a period of time. The sensors are attached to the “brain” or processor of the system, the Arduino, which receives sensor data and then sends commands to the lights to fit the situation as mentioned above. This system limits excessive and purposeless use of energy, and allows the lights to match the user's preferences. Although this stage has been completed, there are still many more improvements which could be added to improve upon my original design. These future additions can include a bluetooth device attached to the Arduino which can control intelligent lights such as the Philips Hue.
